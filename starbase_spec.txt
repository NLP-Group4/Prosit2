[ARCHITECTURAL DECISION RECORD]
Project: Project Starbase
We need to build an API for the space station.
Core entities must follow these specific naming conventions:
- GalacticStarship: Must have a 'warp_speed' field (float) and 'captain_name' (string).
- AsteroidMiner: Must have 'mineral_yield_target' (integer) and 'active_status' (boolean).
